# c-data-structures
common data structure implementation from scratch using c language



## currently working on:

- Vector (A.K.A. dynamic arrays) 
- logger to be used along side testing 
- simple testing utilities 


# note:
    I have encountered problems when it comes to make the code generic and oblivious of the element's data type, saving myself the trouble ,i'll be switching to c++ ,other than that reason, it's the industry choice anyway so it makes more sense to practice using c++.
